# Aruco-Markers
Here I have included the folder containing Aruco tags for each cube and each side of the cube. Also I have included the python code with which we can generate the aruco markers and also detect the aruco markers from any frame.

Since the no of aruco marker images were too much I am providing the google drive link to access the folder consisting these images :
